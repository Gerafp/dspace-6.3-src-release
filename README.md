## Contributing

DSpace is a community built and supported project. We do not have a centralized development or support team,
but have a dedicated group of volunteers who help us improve the software, documentation, resources, etc.

We welcome contributions of any type. Here's a few basic guides that provide suggestions for contributing to DSpace:
* [How to Contribute to DSpace](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/How+to+Contribute+to+DSpace): How to contribute in general (via code, documentation, bug reports, expertise, etc)
* [Code Contribution Guidelines](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Code+Contribution+Guidelines): How to give back code or contribute features, bug fixes, etc.
* [DSpace Community Advisory Team (DCAT)](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/cmtygp/DSpace+Community+Advisory+Team): If you are not a developer, we also have an interest group specifically for repository managers. The DCAT group meets virtually, once a month, and sends open invitations to join their meetings via the [DCAT mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/DSpaceCommunityAdvisoryTeam).

We also encourage GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) at any time. Please see our [Development with Git](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Development+with+Git) guide for more info.
